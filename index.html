        <h3>My Trip to Fire Island</h3>
        <p>ChatGPT said:I recently spent time exploring Fire Island National Seashore, and the experience felt like stepping into a peaceful, 
            untouched world just beyond the reach of New York City. The island's long stretch of pristine shoreline, shifting dunes, and quiet salt marshes 
            created a calm atmosphere perfect for slow walks and photography. One of the most memorable parts of the trip was visiting 
            the Sunken Forest — an ancient maritime holly forest hidden behind dunes — where the shaded boardwalk made it easy to take in both the scenery 
            and the unique ecology of the area.

            I also explored the Otis Pike High Dune Wilderness, the only federally designated wilderness area in New York State, and climbed the iconic 
            Fire Island Lighthouse for sweeping ocean and bay views. Wildlife was abundant throughout the visit, from seabirds gliding along the surf 
            to white-tailed deer wandering near the trails. Even brief moments, like watching dolphins move just off the coastline, made the park feel alive and full of surprises.

            Overall, Fire Island combined natural beauty, cultural history, and a sense of calm that's rare so close to a major city. It's a place that 
            balances preservation with accessibility, making it ideal for both relaxation and exploration.
